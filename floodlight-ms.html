        <h2 class="project-overview-headline">Project overview</h2>

        <p class="project-overview-copy">Genentech and Roche’s Floodlight MS, is app that allows patients living with MS to complete simple tasks on their devices to capture data that tracks disease progression and allows their providers to interpret  these objective measures through a provider portal. The Floodlight MS app closes gaps in communication and reduces subjectivity in patient reported symptoms. My team was involved in two phases of the website that partners with the app.</p>

        <h3 class="project-problem-headline">The Problem</h3>
        <p class="project-problem-statemnt">The true challenges came down to limited real estate and time. The first phase of of the site served as a pre-launch introduction to the Floodlight MS app and had minimal content. The brief called for the full launch website to have a much more robust content strategy,  which was directly in conflict with the imperative for a minimalistic layout with few pages. Additionally A highly consolidated timeline leading to launch required a new approach to    working efficiently.</p>

        <h3 class="project-solution-headline">The Solution</h3>
        <p class="project-solution-statemnt">Careful consideration of the site architecture and collaboration between UX and copywriting allowed us to deliver robust content in a minimalist layout. We reassessed a legacy workflow between UX and creative direction and shifted our approach to minimize inefficiencies.  By partnering to work in succession with one file; UX and art significantly reduced the time required to transition wireframes into creative design.</p>

      <h2 class="brief-headline">Interpreting the brief</h2>
      <p class= "brief-introduction">In the second phase of the Floodlight MS project, we were challenged to update the site, expanding from the one-page layout of the first phase and introducing a second page with deeper, more clinical content for providers. We were to build upon the established look and feel of the previous microsite but expand significantly upon the content, applying a mobile first approach.</p>
      <h3 class="brief-list-title" >Key considerations included</h3>
      <ul class="brief-list-content">
        <li><p>The scalable, mobile first, site needs to be <strong>content rich, but visually light</strong>.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Prioritize reusing previously approved content</strong> already reviewed by governance risk & compliance (GRC).</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Brand new HCP-specific content</strong> will provided a deep-dive into usage, benefits and onboarding.</p></li>
        <li><p>We could add <strong>only one new page</strong> to the existing 1-page microsite structure</p></li>
        <li><p>We would <strong>design a global site</strong> and the site design would be provided to and adapted for use by local affiliates, adhering to their local laws and regulations governing medical device messaging.</p></li>
        <li><p>We were to take inspiration from sites that <strong>reflect the client's design vision.</strong></p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Design with the KPIs in mind</strong>: success would be measured by the number of visitors, requests for more info and requests for demo.</p></li>

      <h3 class="inspiration-headline">Looking to inspiration</h3>
      <p class="inspiration-intro"> The client was inspired not only by the sleek look and feel of sites like Oleena.com, but by the well-crafted inclusion of deeper content than is visually apparent upon first glance.  We wanted the visual layout to provide a deeper look into the product, without the visual clutter that’s inherent to an in depth content strategy.  A one page layout and artful use of anchor links, iconography, tabs, and hover states were all design patterns that we saw contribute to the overall light and airy experience that we needed to keep in mind as we worked to the strategize how to overcome the disparity between content and page real-estate.</p>

      <h3 class="sitemap-headline">Sitemap and content strategy</h3>
      <p class="sitemap-intro">Developing the phase two sitemap happened in close collaboration with the copywriting team. The primary homepage departed from 3 three main sections and expanded to 5.

      <p class="floodlight-wireframe-intro">With the sitemap and manuscript approved by the client, it was time to plan individual page infastructure by preparing a set of wireframes.  The agency’s UX workflow may incorporate a variety of design tools for wireframing as directed by client need that include programs such as Sketch, Figma and Adobe XD.<br><br>Without a client directive, we primarily recommend Sketch because it’s an industry leader and provides a wide swath of functionality to design, prototype, and collaborate on projects. Sketch has partnerships for collaboration with some of our most commonly used tools, such as Zeplin, a resource for handing off design files to our client’s development teams and it provides a good balance of stability and expanding capabilities. New plugins mean that Sketch can be customized to meet a seemingly endless array of project needs.<br><br>Most importantly, Sketch files are increasingly becoming one of the most requested UX design deliverables for handoff.<br><br> As we moved forward with Sketch wireframes, our collaboration with copywriting had allowed for opportunity to provide feedback on what components would best tell the story in the manuscript. Those components were brought into wireframes and evolved through several iterations. </p>

      <h2 class="art-direction-headline">Advocating for art direction in Sketch</h2>
      <p class="art-direction-intro">Moving into the creative direction phase I handed off my sketch files via Sketch Cloud allowing the creative designer to join the file, duplicate my wire frame pages and use them as the basis for the creative design.
        <br><br>Employing the Sketch symbols feature early in the wire framing stage empowered us to turn items as complex as entire sections of the website into recurring elements. This made it extremely easy to make quick updates to the look and feel of components and update copywriting as the client’s promotional review committee shared revisions. When changes were made to a symbol, this automatically pulled through to all artboards that contain that symbol.
        <br><br>The creative designer appreciated working with sketch artboards over the layer comps in Photoshop because it was easier to see all states of the site together at one time in Sketch. The way the artboards are laid out in Sketch makes it easy to ensure everything is included and that all elements align well.
        <br><br>I collaborated closely with creative design during this stage to make usability revisions including the inclusion of the transcript overlay for the homepage’s hero section video, and inclusion of video overlays of the app activities on the provider’s page.
      </p>
      <h3 class="revisions-for-accessibility-headline">Revisions for accessibility</h3>
      <p class="revisions-for-accessibility-intro">Every project needs to be designed with accessibility in mind, so I also provided extensive consultation on how to adhere to the WCAG 2.1 AA standard for accessibility. Color contrast proved challenging to maneuver because, as is often the case, brand colors were approved by the client before our engagement and limited opportunities to create high contrast without close consideration. We also made several revisions to ensure that more obscure   guidelines were adhered to, such as the need to ensure that videos and animations of 5 seconds or more have a way to be paused, stopped or hidden.
      </p>
      <h3 class="benefits-to-creative-design-headline">Benefits to Creative Design</h3>
      <p class="benefits-to-creative-design-intro">By eliminating the shift from Sketch wireframes to creative layout in Photoshop, we reduced the opportunities for human error and duplicative work. Sketch symbols eliminated the need to make repetitive updates across many layer comps. We shaved days off of our timeline and got our project approved through the client’s promotional reviews committee and handed off to the client’s development team on time.</p>
