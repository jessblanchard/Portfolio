      <p class="inspiration-intro"> The client was inspired not only by the sleek look and feel of sites like Oleena.com, but by the well-crafted inclusion of deeper content than is visually apparent upon first glance.  We wanted the visual layout to provide a deeper look into the product, without the visual clutter that’s inherent to a complex content strategy.  A one page layout and artful use of anchor links, iconography, tabs, and hover states were all design patterns that we saw contribute to the overall light and airy experience that we needed to keep in mind as we worked to strategize how to overcome the disparity between content and page real-estate.</p>

The new HCP directed page would include six key content areas intended to  drive users through the funnel toward adoption.

      <h3 class="floodlight-wireframes">Wireframes</h3>
      <p class="floodlight-wireframe-intro">With the sitemap and manuscript approved by the client, it was time to plan individual page infastructure by preparing a set of wireframes.  The agency’s UX workflow may incorporate a variety of design tools for wireframing as directed by client needs that include programs such as Sketch, Figma and Adobe XD.<br><br>Without a client directive, we primarily recommend Sketch because it’s an industry leader and provides a wide swath of functionality to design, prototype, and collaborate on projects. Sketch has partnerships for collaboration with some of our most commonly used tools, such as Zeplin, a resource for handing off design files to our client’s development teams and it provides a good balance of stability and expanding capabilities. New plugins mean that Sketch can be customized to meet a seemingly endless array of project needs.<br><br>Most importantly, Sketch files are increasingly becoming one of the most requested UX design deliverables for handoff.<br><br> As we moved forward with Sketch wireframes, our collaboration with copywriting had allowed for opportunity to provide feedback on what components would best tell the story in the manuscript. Those components were brought into wireframes and evolved through several iterations. </p>

    <section class="art-direction">
      <h2 class="art-direction-headline">Collaborating with creative design</h2>
      <p class="art-direction-intro">Moving into the creative direction phase I handed off my sketch files via Sketch Cloud allowing the creative designer to join the file, duplicate my wire frame pages and use them as the basis for the creative design.
        <br><br>Employing the Sketch symbols feature early in the wire framing stage empowered us to turn items as complex as entire sections of the website into recurring elements. This made it extremely easy to make quick updates to the look and feel of components and update copywriting as the client’s promotional review committee shared revisions. When changes were made to a symbol, this automatically pulled through to all artboards that contain that symbol.
        <br><br>The creative designer appreciated working with Sketch artboards over the layer comps in Photoshop because it was easier to see all states of the site together at one time in Sketch. The way the artboards are laid out side-by-side in Sketch makes it easy to ensure that every visual state is accounted for in a harmonious and  consistent way.
        <br><br>I collaborated closely with creative design during this stage to make functional updates such as including a transcript overlay for the homepage’s hero section video, and including video overlays of the app activities on the provider’s page.
      </p>
      <h3 class="revisions-for-accessibility-headline">Revisions for accessibility</h3>
      <p class="revisions-for-accessibility-intro">Wireframes were prepared with accessibility in mind, but its important that accessible design is carried throughout all phases of the project. So I also provided extensive consultation on how to adhere to the WCAG 2.1 AA standard for accessibility. Color contrast proved challenging to maneuver because, as is often the case, brand colors were approved by the client before our engagement and limited opportunities to create high contrast without close consideration. We also made several revisions to ensure that more obscure   guidelines were adhered to, such as the need to ensure that videos and animations of 5 seconds or more have a way to be paused, stopped or hidden.
      </p>
      <h3 class="benefits-to-creative-design-headline">The benefits of our collaborative workflow</h3>
      <p class="benefits-to-creative-design-intro">We were able to seamlesssly work through modifications for accessibility,  continued client changes and new requests after creative design began without a delay to our timeline because our modular approach to content sections, organized workspace and collaboration in one file allowed us to work with efficient unity.</p>
