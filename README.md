# My Portfolio

This portfolio is a shortcase of my work during the bloc design program (and beyond). It includes a homepage providing an introduction, preview of my work and short bio. Additional pages include an expanded bio page and a case study.

# Development Challenges

Implementing CSS grid was a challenge. After undertstanding the limitations and inefficiency of static-placed elements, I embarked on learning how to use this for a fluid and responsive design. Albeit challenging challenging, this was an essential part of efficiently tackling the project

# Next Steps

continue to elevate responsivity and animations for a better UI, regularly update with new work and redesign as needed to address evolving user needs.
