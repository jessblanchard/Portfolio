            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Verve for iOS is a cloud storage app that promotes good health and wellness through organization and collaboration. While allowing users to upload, organize and share any kind of document, Verve places a priority on files that relate to your self care products, notes and activities and provides useful insights on how to make healthier choices to achieve your goals.</p>
          </div>
          <div class = "problem">
              <h2>Problem</h2>
              <p>The client challenged us to find an entry into the cloud storage with a unique set of features to meet the needs of a particular audience.
              </p>

          <div class = "solution">
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>I identified a niche audience and market opportunity for a  cloud storage solution that encourages better grooming, health and wellness.  I designed Verve for iOS  to give users a streamlined cloud storage solution with the added benefit of useful insights.</p>

            <h2>Discovery & Research</h2>
            <h3>User Survey</h3>
            <p>I embarked on the project by first surveying a group of participants to better understand how they use cloud storage.</p>
            <table class="survey-chart">

            <h3>User Personas</h3>
            <p>The survey provided great insight into the attitudes and opinions of potential users, and I constructed two personas based on the survey responses to represent the trends I spotted.</p>

            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <p>I analyzed four competitors, Google Drive, Dropbox, Flöka and LovelyLoot . The most important revelation was that while general providers are overlooking niches, niche providers are severely limiting functionality. Neither provides  both general use and opportunity for specialization.

            <p>After initially creating one large flow to represent the three main processes users would undertake, I divided them into four user flow groups to be more digestible:

                <li>2. Upload or create content</li>

            <h3>Site Map & Content Strategy</h3>
            <p>I created a site map and detailed the content strategy for further clarity on how the solution would be organized, page by page. I would come to find that rather than being an exhaustive accounting for every page the final product would have, it was more of an overview including the key pages.</P>
            <p>Laying out the pages and content in this early stage revealed many questions about how the product would develop.</p>

            <p>I found that there were screens that should be consolidated, some that were not useful and some that were overlooked in sketching, such as the difference between the dashboard of a new user vs that of a returning user and the view of a text Input window after a user enters the text and before they proceed to click a link. As a result, my sketches are different from my  lo-fi wireframes but reflect a series of digital iterations after these discoveries and review during a design critique.</p>

            <h3>User Testing Lo-Fi Wireframes</h3>
            <p>I recruited three user testers to evaluate the protoype’s usability. They were asked to complete three tasks.
              <ul>
                <li>1. Sign up for an account</li>
                <li>1. Add a piece of content</li>
                <li>1. Organize a piece of content</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Key Takeaways</p>
            <li>I should revisit the availability of the free signup pathway and the wording of the buttons on the landing page to better indicate how a new user can get started.</li>
            <li>I need to consider adjusting a future testing script to better reflect the sorts of concerns that I expect to arise during testing and I need to be more explicit about the directions given, such as asking users to sign up for the premium account rather than leaving the choice up to them.</li>

            <h2>Branding</h2>
            <h3>Naming: Brainstorming and mindmapping</h3>
            <p>I engaged in brainstorming and mindmapping exercised to narrow down naming ideas and settled on Verve because it was a short moniker that embodied he clean energy and vitality the app needed to project.</p>
            <p>The branding should reflect the app’s positioning at the intersection of self care and data while maintaining a clean and sleek interface. </p>

            <h3>Logo Design</h3>
            <p>My initial logo sketches explored ways to incorporate a monographic “v” and imagery to indicate the cloud and data insight aspects of the service.</p>
            <div>
              <img src = "images/Branding/logo-sketches.png"</img>
            </div>
            <p>I created digital refinements of a few of the ideas and conducted an early round of preference tests for clarity on which ideas were the strongest.</P>

              </tr>
            </table>
            <p>Based on the results of an early preference test, I reduced my number of digital sketches and further refined them.</p>
            <table class ="logos-round-2">
              <tr>
                <td><img src = "images/Branding/Logos Round 2/Logo1.png"</img></td>

              </tr>
            </table>
            <p>In a second round of preference tests and a subsequent design critique, Option 2 performed the best. While close to being a solid solution,  because of its simplicity, implementation of the V monogram and allusion to the statistical data of the Verve insights and data features, it did require some minor adjustments. </p>
            <img src = "images/Branding/Logo Final/Group 2.2.png"</img>
            <h3>Typography</h3>
            <p>I chose Geosans Light  as  the brand typefaces because it delicately compliments  the bold shapes of the Verve logo mark while remaining minimal and modern.

                I chose  Montserrat as a  complimentary typeface for use throughout the app for its readability. As with the brand typefaces I wanted to use a font that would be minimal and modern.</P>
            <img src = "images/Branding/typography.png"</img>
            <h3>Color Pallete and Style Guide</h3>
            <p>I began to research which colors that would help users establish expectations early on in their interaction with the app.  I considered what various colors and combinations would convey, energy, health, wellness and purity. I looked at the colors used by competitors and started out with preference testing a few color palettes.
            <p>A blue tone palette was preferred by 63% of respondents. This confirmed my early inclinations about colors that would be suitable. I also found that blue was heavily used by competitors and color theory research revealed that this is a reliable and trusted choice, so not an unpopular one.</p>
            <p>Wanting to add more dynamism and depth to my color palette, I tested user response to combining gradients. This was preferred 67% of the time.</p>
            <p>Based on client feedback, I made slight adjustments to the palette and decided to use a gradient shade of blue as the primary color, in combination with a gradient shade of pink, in combination with gray, white, black and yellow.</p>
            <img src= "images/Branding/Colors/color1.png"</img>
            <img src= "images/Branding/Colors/color2.png"</img>
            <img src= "images/Branding/Colors/color3.png"</img>

            <img src= "images/Branding/Colors/color5.png"</img>
            <img src= "images/Branding/Colors/color6.png"</img>
            <p>I proceeded to prepare a full style guide that included the color palette along side additional branding guidelines such as typography, logo usage, and iconography. </p>

            <h3>High Fidelity Mockups<h3>
            <p>As I created hi-fi mockups, I  discovered design elements that previously seemed to recede into the background of the app, but in actuality needed to be considered as part of a design pattern. Design features like process tracking dots and text captioning on menu icons, needed to be considered as I was developing  high fidelity mockups.</p>
            <img src= "images/HiFi Mockups/activity-mockup.png"</img>
            <img src= "images/HiFi Mockups/existing-user-dashboard-mockup.png"</img>

            <img src= "images/HiFi Mockups/product-mockup.png"</img>
            <h3>Preference Testing</h3>
            <p>There were still a few design decisions that I was uncertain about. Rather than choosing them based on my own preferences, it was important to get feedback from potential users. I preference tested various components such as button style, insights dashboard layout and landing page copywriting.</p>
            <img src= "images/Preference Testing/button-styles.png"</img>
            <img src= "images/Preference Testing/insights-dashboards.png"</img>
            <img src= "images/Preference Testing/homepage1.png"</img>
            <img src= "images/Preference Testing/homepage1.png"</img>
            <p>I discovered that a solid blue button style, a one-screen dashboard view and direct, unquestioning text were overwhelmingly preferred. These revelations guided me as made a few changes before retesting my prototype.</p>
            <h3>User Testing the Hi-Fi Mockup</h3>
            <p>Once again, I recruited three user testers to evaluate the prototype’s usability. They were asked to complete three tasks.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Sign up for an account</li>
              <li>Add a piece of contentt</li>
              <li>Organize a piece of content</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Key Takeaways</p>
            <p>Following testing, I concluded that the application is best used by those with some existing familiarity with mobile applications, such as my target audience. One of the usability testers had limited experience with mobile applications and struggled with identifying visual cues indicating next steps. Further consideration could be given to engaging users with limited experience, but this called for a design approach that would be overly explanatory for our target user. Even users familiar with mobile apps appeared to be in need of better cues and directions in menu navigation.</p>
            <h3>Final Revisions</h3>
            <p>I considered that usability testers were having difficulty in determining which upload option to use to create a new product. While they ultimately did it successfully, it required multiple attempts and consideration to determine which menu options to use so I adjusted the menu options. </p>
            <img src= "images/Final Revisions/menus.png"</img>
            <p>Based on design critique feedback, I made improvements to the empty state dashboards, providing a boundary to more clearly indicate the emptiness of the repository and including a call to action to “add your first file”.</p>
            <img src= "images/Final Revisions/dashboard.png"</img>
            <p>I also adjusted the photo and file uploading screens to adhere to iOS Human Interface Guidelines to avoid adding an unfamiliar process with minimal experience value. At this stage, the product met all of the needs of the initial client brief, the needs revealed through user research, accounted for the feedback received in testing and critiques and incorporated Human Interface Guidelines. </p>

            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
            <h3>Ask the Right Questions</h3>
            <p>Survey design is an important part of starting a project on the right foot. You won’t get the answers to questions you don’t know to ask if you haven’t put great effort into considering what you may need to know later on in your design process.</p>
            <h3>Consider the Hidden Steps in a Process</h3>
            <p>When digital wireframing, it was tempting to create 1:1 screen adaptations from my sketches and paper wireframes. However, many steps and states are omitted by proceeding in that way. Empty states, interactive states and other intermediating screens need to be included as well. </p>
            <h3>Innovate Where Useful</h3>
            <p>Consider the ago old adage, don’t reinvent the wheel. I created an original image uploading process that increased the cognitive load of users but added nothing of additional value. It was far more useful to use the iOS Human Interface Guidelines processes for uploading files and images, because users would be familiar with it and not need to learn a new process. </p>
