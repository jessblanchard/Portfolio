            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>I discovered an opportunity to improve the way that companies approach social impact strategies and designed Intent partners, a social impact consultancy offering a suite of management services and digital mapping tools.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="problem">
              <h2>Problem</h2>
              <p>The client, Intent Partners, a startup social impact agency, needed to create a digital presence that differentiated  them from organizations with similar missions.

          <div class="solution">
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>Discovering that employees are unclear about how to drive corporate social impact and that consumers are seeking transparency, the project seeked to fill a previously unmet market need by designing tools for companies to see and pursue local micro impacts and for consumers to seek out businesses that commit to their local community. The intent partners site was designed to introduce the company and its services while filling this unmet need. </p>

          <h3>Site Map & Content Strategy</h3>
          <p>I evaluated the user flows and created a site map to document the pages/sections needed to be constructed for a user to achieve each flow. I then created sketches and wireframes to determine how to best visually represent the components of the map. Knowing what a potential layout may look like allowed me to begin to consider the text and graphical content required to most efficiently communicate what was necessary in each area of the web app.</br></br>As I was working on this, I considered how to best structure menus, what deserved a seperate page and what would be best shown on a scrolling one page landing.So how would these pages tell the story? The content needed to cover all the bases so extensive thought went into what each area of the site would contain and it was compiled to begin strategizing a plan.</br></br>It was challenging to create an architecture that packed significant content in an approachable way that wasnt overbearingly heavy on the number of pages.</p>

            <p>I should revisit the availability of the free signup pathway and the wording of the buttons on the landing page to better indicate how a new user can get started.</p>
            <p>I need to consider adjusting a future testing script to better reflect the sorts of concerns that I expect to arise during testing and I need to be more explicit about the directions given, such as asking users to sign up for the premium account rather than leaving the choice up to them.</p>

              <h3>Naming: Brainstorming and Mindmapping</h3>
              <p>The client had already decided on a name and wanted to include bullhorn imagery in the branding but there was a lot of room to decide how to implement this.</p>
              <p class="branding-p2">It was useful to think about the iconography and energy around the concepts that are inherent to the social responsibility industry.</p>
              <div class="branding-theme">
                  <img class="intent-mindmap" src="intent_partners_images/mind_mapping.png" alt="mindmap">

            </div>
            <div class="logo-design">
              <h3>Logo Design</h3>
              <p>Because the client wanted to include bullhorn imagery, reminiscent of marches and grassroots action in the logo, this was kept in mind when it was time to sketch early concepts.</p>
              <img class="logo-sketches" src="intent_partners_images/logo_sketches.png" alt="Logo Sketches">
              <p>Early sketches were preference tested for clarity on which images were most pleasing to viewers and results showed that two options  performed the best, each garnering 33%  of votes.</P>
              <div class="intent-logo-round">
                <img class="intent-logo-option-1" src="intent_partners_images/option_1.png" alt="Logo option 1">
                <img class="intent-logo-option-2" src="intent_partners_images/option_2.png" alt="Logo option 2">
              </div>
              <p>Both were refined and preference tested directly against one another. While both included the bullhorn imagery, option 1 is markedly more creative, and visually engaging, but possibly too busy to meet the clean and simple aesthetic that's desires. Option 2 is clean, and easy to read but perhaps too common feeling. </p>
              <div class="intent-logo-round">
                <img class="intent-logo-option-1" src="intent_partners_images/logos/option_1_refined.png" alt="Logo option 1">

              </div>
              <p>While the results were pretty evenly divided, the comments brought some things to light. Readability was a issue in option 1 but it was preferred for its “cleverness”. Option 2 didn't flow and the hand wasn't … preferred, but it was more “readable”.  How could I keep things clever but still readable? I went back to the drawing board to rustle up new ideas.</p>
              <img class="logo-sketches" src="intent_partners_images/logos/logos_reconsidered.jpg" alt="Logos Reconsidered">
              <p>Ultimately a refinement of option 1 accounting for the common concerns proved the strongest option.</p>

            <p>Several improvements were considered and defined moving from wireframe to high fidelity mock-up. For instance,  adding calls to action in spaces where they added usability value but weren’t decidedly necessary earlier for minimum functionality.</p>
            <p>Choosing compelling imagery that was engaging and not overly illustrative to the point of being cliche proved challenging. I chose to focus on imagery that captured the spirit and essence of the company’s modern and youthful, yet mature perspective.</p>

            <p>Mockups were reviewed for opportunities for improvement. Recommendations primarily centered on improving typography in ways such as:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><p>Reduce the height of the header and increasing font weight for improved accessibility</p></li>
                <li><p>Make team members professional titles smaller and closer under names<p></li>
                <li><p>Make footer text smaller than subscribe section<p></li>
                <li><p>Ensure all text adheres to maximum characters per line guidelines<p></li>

Results would be better called “case studies” for the same reason. Changing these labels to be more intuitive will make it easier for an inexperienced user to navigate the site.</p>

            <h3> In Closing</h3>
            <p>Intent Partners presented the challenge to create a digital brand and presence for their consultancy as they move forward in formally establishing their organization. While they had a wide breadth of accomplishments credited to them, the vision was not fully articulated and reflective of current market and user needs. After investigating both and iteratively testing solutions to meet both the consumer need for social impact transparency and business need for local access, we have designed an MVP Product to position Intent Partners as a unique consultancy that offers not only their expertise, but a growing set of digital tools that empower any user to encourage and support the conversation around corporate social impact.</br></br>Next steps for this project include development and deployment. <a class="intent-landing-link" href="https://jessblanchard.github.io/intent_partners/" target="_blank">A landing page</a>, using HTML5 and CSS3, has been deployed while full development is underway.</p>

            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
            <h3>Keep Code in Mind</h3>
            <p>I design solutions keeping the user and market needs in mind first, but also with developmental capabilities as well. In considering the application of mapping tools,  it was valuable to consider the complexity of development required to achieve certain goals and tailor this to the particular projects restraints.</p>
            <h3>Be Open Minded</h3>
            <p>Research will throw unexpected information at you. Sometimes your project will allow for exploration of it, and at times, it won't. When I set out to better meet the needs of corporate clients, I discovered that providing a tool to their consumers also benefitted my original goal in a synergistic way. If I had not been open to exploring unexpected solutions, a valuable and unique approach could have been missed.</p>
