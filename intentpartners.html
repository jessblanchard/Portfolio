            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>I discovered an opportunity to improve the way that companies approach social impact strategies and designed Intent partners, a social impact consultancy offering a suite of management services and digital mapping tools.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="problem">
              <h2>Problem</h2>
              <p>The client, Intent Partners, a startup social impact agency, needed to create a digital presence that differentiated  them from organizations with similar missions.
              </p>
            </div>
          <div class="solution">
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>Discovering that employees are unclear about how to drive corporate social impact and that consumers are seeking transparency, the project seeked to fill a previously unmet market need by designing tools for companies to see and pursue local micro impacts and for consumers to seek out businesses that commit to their local community. The intent partners site was designed to introduce the company and its services while filling this unmet need. </p>

                <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                <p>Impactual,  Do Something Strategic,  and Bridgespan Group are three consultancies that take a unique apporoch to advising their clients on developing powerful  social impact initiatives. Impactual touts it focus on real impact over optics, Do Something Strategic provides unique access to proprietary data on the Gen Z and millennial audience, and veteran leader, Bridgespan Group advises change-making organizations and investors.</p>
                <p>While they all use story telling to demonstrate their individual acumen, none tackle the needs expressed by users, such as provide a transparent tool for consumers to identify real-impact focused businesses, proprietary opportunity discovery and  impact managing tools, and resources to activate the corporate workforce as impact evangelists. </p>

          <h3>Site Map & Content Strategy</h3>
          <p>I evaluated the user flows and created a site map to document the pages/sections needed to be constructed for a user to achieve each flow. I then creates sketches and wireframes to determine how to best visually represent the components of the map. Knowing what a potential layout may look like allowed me to begin to consider the text and graphical content required to most efficiently communicate what was necessary in each area of the web app.
            </P>
          <p>As I was working on this, I considered how to best structure menus, what deserved a seperate page and what would be best shown on a scrolling one page landing.</P>
          <p>So how would these pages tell the story? The content needed to cover all the bases so extensive thought went into what each area of the site would contain and it was compiled to begin strategizing a plan. </p>
          <p>It was challenging to create an architecture that packed significant content in an approachable way that wasnt overbearingly heavy on the number of pages. </p>

            <p>I began to research which colors that would help users establish expectations early on in their interaction with the app.  I considered what various colors and combinations would convey, energy, health, wellness and purity. I looked at the colors used by competitors and started out with preference testing a few color palettes.
            <p>A blue tone palette was preferred by 63% of respondents. This confirmed my early inclinations about colors that would be suitable. I also found that blue was heavily used by competitors and color theory research revealed that this is a reliable and trusted choice, so not an unpopular one.</p>
            <p>Wanting to add more dynamism and depth to my color palette, I tested user response to combining gradients. This was preferred 67% of the time.</p>
            <p>Based on client feedback, I made slight adjustments to the palette and decided to use a gradient shade of blue as the primary color, in combination with a gradient shade of pink, in combination with gray, white, black and yellow.</p>

            <p>There were still a few design decisions that I was uncertain about. Rather than choosing them based on my own preferences, it was important to get feedback from potential users. I preference tested various components such as button style, insights dashboard layout and landing page copywriting.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><p>1. Sign up for an account</p></li>

            <p><strong class="chart-emphasis"> Key Takeaways</strong></p>
            <p>Following testing, I concluded that the application is best used by those with some existing familiarity with mobile applications, such as my target audience. One of the usability testers had limited experience with mobile applications and struggled with identifying visual cues indicating next steps. Further consideration could be given to engaging users with limited experience, but this called for a design approach that would be overly explanatory for our target user. Even users familiar with mobile apps appeared to be in need of better cues and directions in menu navigation.</p>

            <p>I considered that usability testers were having difficulty in determining which upload option to use to create a new product.

            <p>I also adjusted the photo and file uploading screens to adhere to iOS Human Interface Guidelines to avoid adding an unfamiliar process with minimal experience value. At this stage, the product met all of the needs of the initial client brief, the needs revealed through user research, accounted for the feedback received in testing and critiques and incorporated Human Interface Guidelines. </p>
            <h3> In Closing</h3>
            <p>Verve satisfies the client brief by successfully pursuing a unique entry into the cloud storage market for a wellness and productivity-minded consumer. With the client brief providing a strong framework within which to explore and develop the idea, the end product's design  is truly driven by user research and testing so that the client sees optimal results in monetizing the product.</p>

            <h3>Keep Code in Mind</h3>
            <p>I design solutions keeping the user and market needs in mind first, but also with developmental capabilities as well. In considering the application of mapping tools,  it was valuable to consider the complexity of development required to achieve certain goals and tailor this to the particular projects restraints.</p>
            <h3>Be Open Minded</h3>
            <p>Research will throw unexpected information at you. Sometimes your project will allow for exploration of it, and at time it won't. When I set out to better meet the needs of corporate clients, I discovered that providing a tool to their consumers also benefitted my original goal in a synergetic way. If I had not been open to exploring unexpected solutions, a valuable and unique approach could have been missed.</p>
