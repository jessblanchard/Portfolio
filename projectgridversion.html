                <p>I analyzed four competitors, Google Drive, Dropbox, Lovelyloot and Fl√∂ka and LovelyLoot. The most important revelation was that while general providers are overlooking niches, niche providers are severely limiting functionality. Neither provides  both general use and opportunity for specialization.</p>

          <p>I created a site map and detailed the content strategy for further clarity on how the solution would be organized, page by page. I would come to find that rather than being an exhaustive accounting for every page the final product would have, it was more of an overview including the key pages.</P>
          <p>Laying out the pages and content in this early stage revealed many questions about how the product would develop.</p>

As a result, my sketches are different from my  lo-fi wireframes but reflect a series of digital iterations after these discoveries and review during a design critique.</p>

            <p>I recruited three user testers to evaluate the protoype‚Äôs usability. They were asked to complete three tasks.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><p>1. Sign up for an account</P></li>

            <p> <strong class=chart-emphasis>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
            <p>I should revisit the availability of the free signup pathway and the wording of the buttons on the landing page to better indicate how a new user can get started.</p>
            <p>I need to consider adjusting a future testing script to better reflect the sorts of concerns that I expect to arise during testing and I need to be more explicit about the directions given, such as asking users to sign up for the premium account rather than leaving the choice up to them.</p>

            <p>I began to research which colors that would help users establish expectations early on in their interaction with the app.  I considered what various colors and combinations would convey, energy, health, wellness and purity. I looked at the colors used by competitors and started out with preference testing a few color palettes.
            <p>A blue tone palette was preferred by 63% of respondents. This confirmed my early inclinations about colors that would be suitable. I also found that blue was heavily used by competitors and color theory research revealed that this is a reliable and trusted choice, so not an unpopular one.</p>
            <p>Wanting to add more dynamism and depth to my color palette, I tested user response to combining gradients. This was preferred 67% of the time.</p>
            <p>Based on client feedback, I made slight adjustments to the palette and decided to use a gradient shade of blue as the primary color, in combination with a gradient shade of pink, in combination with gray, white, black and yellow.</p>

            <p>There were still a few design decisions that I was uncertain about. Rather than choosing them based on my own preferences, it was important to get feedback from potential users. I preference tested various components such as button style, insights dashboard layout and landing page copywriting.</p>

            <ul>

            <p><strong class="chart-emphasis"> Key Takeaways</strong></p>
            <p>Following testing, I concluded that the application is best used by those with some existing familiarity with mobile applications, such as my target audience. One of the usability testers had limited experience with mobile applications and struggled with identifying visual cues indicating next steps. Further consideration could be given to engaging users with limited experience, but this called for a design approach that would be overly explanatory for our target user. Even users familiar with mobile apps appeared to be in need of better cues and directions in menu navigation.</p>

            <p>I considered that usability testers were having difficulty in determining which upload option to use to create a new product.

            <p>Survey design is an important part of starting a project on the right foot. You won‚Äôt get the answers to questions you don‚Äôt know to ask if you haven‚Äôt put great effort into considering what you may need to know later on in your design process.</p>
            <h3>Consider the Hidden Steps in a Process</h3>
            <p>When digital wireframing, it was tempting to create 1:1 screen adaptations from my sketches and paper wireframes. However, many steps and states are omitted by proceeding in that way. Empty states, interactive states and other intermediating screens need to be included as well. </p>
            <h3>Innovate Where Useful</h3>
            <p>Consider the ago old adage, don‚Äôt reinvent the wheel. I created an original image uploading process that increased the cognitive load of users but added nothing of additional value. It was far more useful to use the iOS Human Interface Guidelines processes for uploading files and images, because users would be familiar with it and not need to learn a new process. </p>
