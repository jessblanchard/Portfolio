            <p>I began to research which colors that would help users establish expectations early on in their interaction with the app.  I considered what various colors and combinations would convey, energy, health, wellness and purity. I looked at the colors used by competitors and started out with preference testing a few color palettes.
            <p>A blue tone palette was preferred by 63% of respondents. This confirmed my early inclinations about colors that would be suitable. I also found that blue was heavily used by competitors and color theory research revealed that this is a reliable and trusted choice, so not an unpopular one.</p>
            <p>Wanting to add more dynamism and depth to my color palette, I tested user response to combining gradients. This was preferred 67% of the time.</p>
            <p>Based on client feedback, I made slight adjustments to the palette and decided to use a gradient shade of blue as the primary color, in combination with a gradient shade of pink, in combination with gray, white, black and yellow.</p>

Design features like process tracking dots and text captioning on menu icons, needed to be considered as I was developing  high fidelity mockups.</p>

            <p>There were still a few design decisions that I was uncertain about. Rather than choosing them based on my own preferences, it was important to get feedback from potential users. I preference tested various components such as button style, insights dashboard layout and landing page copywriting.</p>

            <p><strong class = "chart-emphasis"> Key Takeaways</strong></p>
            <p>Following testing, I concluded that the application is best used by those with some existing familiarity with mobile applications, such as my target audience. One of the usability testers had limited experience with mobile applications and struggled with identifying visual cues indicating next steps. Further consideration could be given to engaging users with limited experience, but this called for a design approach that would be overly explanatory for our target user. Even users familiar with mobile apps appeared to be in need of better cues and directions in menu navigation.</p>

            <p>I considered that usability testers were having difficulty in determining which upload option to use to create a new product. While they ultimately did it successfully, it required multiple attempts and consideration to determine which menu options to use so I adjusted the menu options. </p>
            <img class = "menus" src= "images/Final Revisions/menus.png"</img>
            <p>Based on design critique feedback, I made improvements to the empty state dashboards, providing a boundary to more clearly indicate the emptiness of the repository and including a call to action to “add your first file”.</p>
            <img class = "empty-state-dashboards" src= "images/Final Revisions/dashboard.png"</img>
            <p>I also adjusted the photo and file uploading screens to adhere to iOS Human Interface Guidelines to avoid adding an unfamiliar process with minimal experience value. At this stage, the product met all of the needs of the initial client brief, the needs revealed through user research, accounted for the feedback received in testing and critiques and incorporated Human Interface Guidelines. </p>

            <h3>Ask the Right Questions</h3>
            <p>Survey design is an important part of starting a project on the right foot. You won’t get the answers to questions you don’t know to ask if you haven’t put great effort into considering what you may need to know later on in your design process.</p>
            <h3>Consider the Hidden Steps in a Process</h3>
            <p>When digital wireframing, it was tempting to create 1:1 screen adaptations from my sketches and paper wireframes. However, many steps and states are omitted by proceeding in that way. Empty states, interactive states and other intermediating screens need to be included as well. </p>
            <h3>Innovate Where Useful</h3>
            <p>Consider the ago old adage, don’t reinvent the wheel. I created an original image uploading process that increased the cognitive load of users but added nothing of additional value. It was far more useful to use the iOS Human Interface Guidelines processes for uploading files and images, because users would be familiar with it and not need to learn a new process. </p>
